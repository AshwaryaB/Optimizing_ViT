# ViT Layerwise Optimization
This project enhances the **efficiency** and **interpretability** of the Vision Transformer (ViT) by analyzing and optimizing each encoder layer.

##  Objectives
- Improve ViT performance on vision tasks.
- Identify and refine underperforming layers.
- Use intrinsic dimensionality (ID) for pruning insights.

##  Features
- Layer-wise output extraction (12 encoder blocks).
- ID estimation using PCA & TwoNN.
- Targeted tuning + pruning experiments.
- Performance evaluation on CIFAR-10.
